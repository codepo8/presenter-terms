<p>Hello I am Chris and I am happy that you are interested in me speaking at your event. I have defined presenter terms and here is an overview. In addition to the ones here, please refer to the <a href="https://christianheilmann.com/2012/04/25/so-you-want-me-to-talk/">So you want me to talk?</a> article on my blog. I am a professional presenter with lots of experience. Therefore I want to make sure that there is no misconception about what I expect and deliver.</p>

<h2 id="-collision-show-stoppers">💥 Show stoppers</h2>
<p>I know it is hard to organise events, so I want to make sure that we are on the same level. Here is a list of things that I will not do. </p>
<ul class="stoppers">
    <li>I will not present at a panel or a conference line-up with an obvious lack of diversity. Our audience comes in all shapes and sizes, so should the experts on stage</li>
    <li>I expect the conference to have an enforced code of conduct </li>
    <li>I don&#39;t &quot;pay to play&quot;. As a presenter, I expect full access to the event.</li>
    <li>I don&#39;t deal with sponsorships of the event and I am not interested in sponsored speaking slots. </li>
    <li>I have a list of people I will not present alongside and I refuse to present at events that have certain sponsors. I will flag that up to you when that is the case. I am sorry, that this is the case, but it helps.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-dancer-my-deliveries-at-your-event">💃  My deliveries at your event</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s what I will do when invited as a presenter at your event.</p>
<ul>
    <li class="ticked"><strong>Deliver a fitting talk for the intended audience.</strong> I tend to deliver a unique talk every time I can and it will be an up-to-date talk.  </li>
    <li class="ticked"><strong>Deliver the talk on time and sticking to the defined format and duration.</strong> I need to know what time frame you expect and what format you want it to be in. I will show up at the times you need me to be there and set up on stage with enough time for AV people to wire up microphones and other equipment. </li>
    <li class="ticked"><strong>Be available for conference attendees.</strong> Conferences to me are more about the people than about the content. Therefore I will try to be there for questions and feedback.</li>
    <li class="ticked"><strong>Be available for other promotional parts of the event.</strong> I am happy to do interviews or give you feedback to use in conference wrap-ups</li>
    <li class="ticked"><strong>Promote my presence at your event.</strong> I will tweet and blog before, during and after the event about what I will do at your event and interesting things I encounter. </li>
    <li class="ticked"><strong>Publish my slides and screen recording after my talk.</strong> If there is a good enough connection, this normally happens right after the presentation. Everything I create at your event will be licensed Creative Commons unless otherwise agreed. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-computer-my-setup">💻  My setup</h2>
<p>I am pretty open to different ways of presenting, but here is my perfect setup</p>
<ul>
    <li class="ticked">I like to use my own computer as I have them set up the way I need and there may be coding examples.</li>
    <li class="ticked">I either use a Surface Book or a Macbook Pro. Both come with Mini Display Ports but I also carry a dongle to connect to HDMI.</li>
    <li class="ticked">I only send slides in advance when there is live translation or signing. Then I will also have a list of terms to translate and put some time aside with the translators to go through the deck.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I need to use a central computer instead of mine, please consider the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li class="ticked">My slides are in PowerPoint and 16:9 format. I will have them on a memory stick with the needed fonts.</li>
    <li class="ticked">I don&#39;t use any audio or video in my slides, but some GIF animations.</li>
    <li class="ticked">I normally don&#39;t need notes, but I want to have a remote clicker and a &quot;nanny screen&quot; where I can see my slides instead of having to refer to the screen behind me.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-pray-my-expectations">🙏 My expectations</h2>

<p>I am a professional presenter, and will do a lot to ensure that the event will be a success. As such, I have a few expections I want met:</p>

<ul>
    <li class="notticked"> <strong>Provide me with a prime speaking slot.</strong> I&#39;ve proven to be a good keynote speaker and find interesting topics to open or close conferences. </li>
    <li class="notticked"> <strong>Deliver a professional stage setup.</strong> I bring my own laptop and connectors, but I expect at least a power plug and a microphone. I am very good with audio engineers (having been one myself) but I am not there to fix audio issues or set up projectors. I expect this to work and be available. I normally don&#39;t need an internet connection, but would love to have one. </li>
    <li class="notticked"> <strong>Record and publish my talk.</strong> Recordings are a great advertisement for your conference and I make sure my presentations make sense without being in the room. </li>
    <li class="notticked"> <strong>Keep me out of sponsorship discussions.</strong> I am at your event as Chris and to present. I will not &quot;pay to play&quot; and I won&#39;t speak at sponsored speaking slots. I am happy to provide you with contacts of who to invite instead. I am also happy to introduce you to company colleagues dealing with sponsorships, but this is not - at all - what I do. If you are looking for a corporate sponsoring to sell speaking slots, please don&#39;t contact me. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-money_with_wings-cost-and-payments-expenses">💸 Cost and payments/expenses</h2>
<p>I am in the lucky position that I have a job that allows me to present. That doesn&#39;t mean though that I want to be a &quot;cheaper&quot; option and stand in the way of people who live off presenting. </p>
<ul>
    <li class="notticked"> <strong>I don&#39;t expect to be paid for my presentations if your conference helps me in my work.</strong> However, to ensure I don&#39;t under-bid peers, I&#39;d like conferences to offer free diversity tickets for the value of a speaker fee instead. </li>
    <li class="notticked"> <strong>If possible, I&#39;d like you to cover my travel and hotel.</strong> I am on stage and need to be able to concentrate on that. I can not do so if I need to find lodgings and organise travel to your event in addition to presenting. I don&#39;t expect first class or business class flights, but I do expect to arrive a day before the event and leave the day after with lodging organised in between. I do not want to book and pay myself and get reimbursed. International payments are a mess and I don&#39;t have time to deal with paper work in between events seeing that I am presenting almost every two weeks. I am sorry if that sounds harsh, but I want to concentrate on my talks, not try to explain to the tax department what all these invoices are about. </li>
</ul>

<p>There are always options to haggle about these things. I&#39;m a reasonable person and if you spend your time creating a great event where money isn&#39;t your main goal, we&#39;ll find a way. </p>

<h2 id="-boom-things-can-go-wrong-">💥 Things can go wrong...</h2>
<p>Even with the best intentions, there may be trouble and I might not be available for your event. You may also change your mind. If that happens, here&#39;s what I want to happen.</p>
<ul>
    <li class="ticked">When I can not attend for some reason or another, I will make very much sure to find a replacement presenter to fill in for me. I have a vast network of peers, mentees and friends who can help out. </li>
    <li class="ticked">When for some reason you decide to slash my speaking slot, I expect you to cover the cost involved for me. Often I can book my own flights as I book other appointments around events. Many of them aren&#39;t refundable.</li>
</ul>
